## what is docker?

Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. By taking advantage of Docker's methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.

## why docker?

- **Faster delivery of your applications**
  Docker helps you ship code faster, test faster, deploy faster, and shorten the cycle between writing code and running code.
- **Solve problems once**
    Docker lets you solve your problems once and then focus on creating value. For example, with Docker you can use any language or toolchain. You can share a container with your coworkers, and be confident that it will work on any machine, regardless of any customized settings that machine might have. Docker helps you ship code faster, test faster, deploy faster, and shorten the cycle between writing code and running code.

## what are containers?

A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.
