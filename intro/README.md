## what is docker?

Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. By taking advantage of Docker's methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.

## why docker?

- **Faster delivery of your applications**
  Docker helps you ship code faster, test faster, deploy faster, and shorten the cycle between writing code and running code.
- **Solve problems once**
    Docker lets you solve your problems once and then focus on creating value. For example, with Docker you can use any language or toolchain. You can share a container with your coworkers, and be confident that it will work on any machine, regardless of any customized settings that machine might have. Docker helps you ship code faster, test faster, deploy faster, and shorten the cycle between writing code and running code.


## what is docker image?

A Docker image is a file, comprised of multiple layers, that is used to execute code in a Docker container.

## what is docker container?

A Docker container is a runtime instance of a Docker image. Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels. All containers are run by a single operating system kernel and therefore use fewer resources than virtual machines. 

## what is docker hub?

Docker Hub is a cloud-based registry service which allows you to link to code repositories, build your images and test them, stores manually pushed images, and links to Docker Cloud so you can deploy images to your hosts. It provides a centralized resource for container image discovery, distribution and change management, user and team collaboration, and workflow automation throughout the development pipeline.

## what is dockerfile?

A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image. Using docker build users can create an automated build that executes several command-line instructions in succession.

## what is docker-compose?

Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application's services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.

## what is docker swarm?

Docker Swarm is a clustering and scheduling tool for Docker containers. With Swarm, IT administrators and developers can establish and manage a cluster of Docker nodes as a single virtual system. Swarm mode also exists natively in Docker Engine.
